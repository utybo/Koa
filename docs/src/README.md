# Koa :id=koa-main

Welcome to Koa's documentation website! Koa is a documentation library for Kotlin.

Koa provides:

- a DSL for OpenAPI to easily define your specifications in Kotlin.
- a Ktor feature for using said DSL right from your Ktor application and serve an OpenAPI document.
- a Ktor feature to serve Swagger UI.

!> Koa is experimental and should not be used in production applications without fully understanding what it does.
